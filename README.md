# Rails 7.0.22 Blog

A ruby on rails application used to learn how ruby on rails works. Application was built in conjunction with the Rails' Getting Started' tutorial. https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#creating-a-new-rails-project 
This was an interesting application to build and gave me the basics in order to create my own applications.

The code was created in the terminal with vim.
